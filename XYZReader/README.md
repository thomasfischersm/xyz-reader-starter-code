# Hey Udacity Reviewer!
I'm a little unsure about the exact directions for the project. That's probably fine because it
mirrors real-world life. On one hand, the instructions encourage to improve the project liberally.
On the other hand, the forum mentors suggest to leave the project structure in place. A forum
post mentions a student whose project got failed for improving the app too much.

For example, the given code has an intend of using a color scheme based on muted colors of the
cover photo. The used library sometimes doesn't return a color. Plus to properly implement
readability and contrast for visual accessibility requires more work. A mentor in a forum post
suggests that using a sensible color scheme to replace the muted colors is more dependable and
acceptable as well.

I've removed quite a bit of code because the Android support library supports close enough
functionality. For example, I removed all the scrolling code and replaced it with Android widgets
that do the right thing.

There are more problems that can be improved. For example, the photo loading performance can be
improved. I'd use Glide and configure it better. However, I stopped short of those things out of
fear that it might be considered as changing the app too much.

So, I'm sending this project in to see how much I'm on track. Where I still have more to improve
and where I improved too much.
